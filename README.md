# study-guide-builder

A Claude Code skill that builds study material for a technical topic you are learning for the first time. It works for a study repo, a learning guide, or notes for an interview or exam.

It is an agent skill, not a program. Claude Code reads the instructions and follows them.

## Why

AI-written study notes have three common problems:

- They are too dense. They read like a spec, not a lesson.
- They define jargon inline, again and again, or not at all.
- They turn branching logic into prose questions that you cannot follow.

Fixing these on a real study repo took about a dozen rounds of corrections. This skill applies all those fixes from the first draft.

## What it does

**Before it writes:**

- Asks you a few clickable questions: scope, time budget, and goal. Each has a recommended answer.
- Gives you a short quiz. Your answers, not your self-report, set the depth.
- If you know a related domain, writes a bridge file first. It maps what you know onto what you are learning.

**While it writes:**

- Checks every fact with [Exa](https://exa.ai) and [Context7](https://context7.com). It never writes a version, price, or product name from memory. Facts that age get a source link.
- Uses short sentences and active voice.
- Gives every file the same shape: why it exists, a glossary, the content, a self-test, a teach-back prompt, and what comes next.
- Opens each section with a real example before the rule.
- Draws decision trees as Mermaid flowcharts. Puts comparisons in tables.
- Cuts anything that does not change a decision.
- Names real tools.

**After it writes:**

- Runs `scripts/check.py` on the guide. The script fails on unclosed code blocks, broken answer blocks, glossary terms that are never used, and multiple-choice answers that lean on one letter.

**After you read:**

- Each file ends with a teach-back prompt. Explain the idea to Claude in your own words. It tells you what you got right, what you missed, and asks one follow-up question.
- Ask for a refresh later. The skill rechecks every dated fact in the guide, shows you a table of what changed, and edits only what you approve.

The full rules are in [`SKILL.md`](skills/study-guide-builder/SKILL.md). The stories behind each rule are in [`references/lessons.md`](skills/study-guide-builder/references/lessons.md). Rules for material that follows a slide deck are in [`references/slide-decks.md`](skills/study-guide-builder/references/slide-decks.md).

## Install

As a plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add AndyMDH/study-guide-builder
/plugin install study-guide-builder
```

As a plain skill folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndyMDH/study-guide-builder.git
cd study-guide-builder
./install.sh
```

The script links the skill into `~/.claude/skills` and the command into `~/.claude/commands`. Add `--project` to install into the current project only. Add `--copy` to copy the files instead of a link.

## Use

With the command:

```
/study-guide Kubernetes networking
/study-guide refresh ~/study/kubernetes
```

Or in plain words:

- "Build me a study guide for X."
- "I have an interview about Y next week. Help me learn it."
- "Explain Z so I actually understand it."
- "Here is my explanation of file 3. Grade it."

To check a guide by hand:

```bash
python3 skills/study-guide-builder/scripts/check.py path/to/guide
```

## Optional

- An `EXA_API_KEY` gives better grounding on fast-moving topics. Without it, the skill asks before it falls back to web search.
- The `simple-english` skill gives the full sentence-level rule set. Without it, this skill applies the core rules itself.
